# Concurrent State Management - Learning Path Phases 1-8

# Getting Started with Phase 1

When you're ready to begin, start with Phase 1. Build the single-threaded baseline, instrument it heavily, and run all the experiments. The measurements you gather will motivate every subsequent phase.

**First concrete task:** Implement a message generator that yields messages at a configurable rate. Make it work, then make it measurable.

Good luck! This is going to be a rewarding journey. 🚀

# Appendix: Phase Summary & Time Estimates

| Phase | Focus | Key Learning | Est. Time |
|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | Sync Baseline | Feel the pain of blocking | 4-8 hours |
| 2 | AsyncIO | I/O concurrency, event loops | 6-10 hours |
| 3 | Multiprocessing | True parallelism, IPC costs | 8-12 hours |
| 4 | Shared Memory | Zero-copy patterns | 6-10 hours |
| 5 | Actor Model | Cross-worker communication | 8-12 hours |
| 6 | msgspec | Serialization optimization | 4-6 hours |
| 7 | Backpressure | Flow control, stability | 8-12 hours |
